Objective: While the camera moves give a indication of position based upon "Ideal Posiition" of the object in our case which is a bottle. When the bottle is still for 3s infront of              our camera we set that position as "Ideal-state" The indication happens through physical attribuites such as LEDs and Buzzer. The indications are,

    * Buzzer - Rings, Which means our camera happpens to be in the "Ideal state" , which is right infront of our object.
    * LEDS - different colors mean different directions and combinations of LEDs are also indicative. The colors mean,

         # RED --> Left
         # White --> Up
         # Green --> Right
         # Blue --> Down

 * Reset -> Through a Push switch we can reset the previously set "Ideal Position" and set a new postion by follwing the same procedure.
